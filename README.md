I don't know how you ended up here but it is what it is I guess. Enjoy your stay. 

### About me
Male, 18, self-taught. I dropped out of school thinking I can handle most of the things myself but apparently not. My biggest achievement is understanding pointers in C. Lately I've been messing around with Bash to automate most of the stuff because I'm lazy to type 3-4 commands to do anything.

#### Languages
- C
- Bash
- Python

Currently using Ubuntu 22.04 LTS but planning to switch to Arch ~~and become a femboy~~ when I actually know what I'm doing. I use Neovim for all of the text editing and zsh as shell.

Sometimes I'm at [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/ReadOnlyException) if I'm not procrastinating or working on a project. 

<sub>I want to contribute to open-source but I honestly have no idea what I'm doing at all.</sub>
